            container.

            * `Expansion`: A chassis that expands the capabilities or capacity of
            another chassis.

            * `Sidecar`: A chassis that mechanically connects with another chassis
            to expand its capabilities or capacity.

            * `Zone`: A logical division or portion of a physical chassis that contains
            multiple devices or systems that cannot be physically separated.

            * `Sled`: TBD

            * `Shelf`: An enclosed or semi-enclosed, typically horizontally-oriented,
            system chassis that must be plugged into a multi-system chassis to function

            to a lower security mode.  This state will transition automatically when
            finished.

            * `Production`: Manager is operating in a normal security mode.  Default
            state for new systems.

            * `HighSecurity`: Manager is operating in high security mode, requiring
            extra authentication on host interface(s), and stronger encryption on
            network interfaces.

            * `FIPS`: Similar to High Security. This mode is intended to meet the
            FIPS 140-2 level 1 and Common Criteria security requirements. A reset
            to defaults is required to exit this mode.

            * `CNSA`: Same as FIPS. Additionally meets the criteria for NSA Commercial
            National Security Algorithm suite.  Must be in FIPS mode to transition
            to CNSA.

            * `SuiteB`: Same as FIPS. Additionally meets the criteria for NSA SuiteB
            Top Secret installations.  Must be in FIPS mode to transition to SuiteB.

            * `SynergySecurityMode`: Synergy Security Mode is the mode supported by

              operation selected

              * `NoAccessEncryptedNoControllerKey`: The logical drive is currently
              encrypted and cannot be accessed because the array controller has not
